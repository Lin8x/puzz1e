## Hints for people who get stuck

**PLEASE DON'T LOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE PHYSICALLY RUN OUT OF OPTIONS**

1. Its not Base64

2. {Hash} Comment Section of 3301 by Lemino. Look for date, and the username of anon I gave you.

3. Replace W with S, google it if you have to; its a communication tool, then login with the email + password. The email isn't a real email, but its VERY similar to a real email service. Google it, you're smart right? Well not really if you're reading the hints section.. but still!
